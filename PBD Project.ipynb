He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism and sexual repression.

       "  'In Ginsberg\\'s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Lucien Carr, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and John Clellon Holmes. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of postâ\\x80\\x93World War II, McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Arthur Rimbaud) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. Barry Gifford, ed., As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady. In the first chapter of his 1957 novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg\\'s association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in On the Road. This was a source of strain in their relationship. \\n',\n",

       "  'Also, in New York, Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso\\'s poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg\\'s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. \\n',\n",

       "  'Shortly after this period in Ginsberg\\'s life, he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation\\'s period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and Come and Join the Dance, which expressed the two women\\'s experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\\n',\n",

       "  'In 1948 in an apartment in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the ancient of days\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself xistence itself was God\" and \" felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe.\"\\n',\n",

There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College: Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch. In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, Bob Kaufman, A. D. Winans, and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the Beatitude poetry magazine.\\n\",\n",

At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it. Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The Six Gallery reading\" took place on October 7, 1955. The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac\\'s novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\\n',\n",

       "  'Ginsberg\\'s principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco\\'s City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among defenders of the First Amendment, and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. Ginsberg and Shig Murao, the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends.

       "  '====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac\\'s Duluoz Legend). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg\\'s experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergâ\\x80\\x99s life. He begins the poem with â\\x80\\x9cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessâ\\x80\\x9d, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. This madness was the â\\x80\\x9cangry fixâ\\x80\\x9d that society needed to functionâ\\x80\\x94madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on â\\x80\\x9cCarl Solomon! Iâ\\x80\\x99m with you in Rocklandâ\\x80\\x9d, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his â\\x80\\x9cstraightjacketâ\\x80\\x9d. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\\n',\n",

Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue GÃ®t-le-Coeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed Bomb and Marriage, and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together Naked Lunch, from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962â\\x80\\x933, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay. He lived with the future President of India Pratibha Patil in Varanasi in 1962.

A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader.

In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing \"Howl\". At the time, such \"sex talk\" employed in \"Howl\" was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law. Raskin, Jonah. American Scream:Allen Ginsberg\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation. California: University of California Press (2004). Ginsberg used phrases such as \"cocksucker\", \"fucked in the ass\", and \"cunt\" as part of the poem\\'s depiction of different aspects of American culture. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including Lady Chatterleyâ\\x80\\x99s Lover. The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even long time lovers. Instead, Ginsberg portrayed casual sex, and used this to comment on the emptiness and constant hunger that could exist in the lives of Americans. For example, in \"Howl\", Ginsberg praises the man \"who sweetened the snatches of a million girls\". Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man \"who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup.\" In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality. The explicit sexual language that filled \"Howl\" eventually led to an important trial on First Amendment issues. Ginsberg\\'s publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges because the poem carried \"redeeming social importance\", Ed. Bill Morgan. \"Howl\" on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression. California: City of Lights (2006). thus setting an important legal precedent. Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 1970-1996, Ginsberg had a long-term affiliation with PEN American Center with efforts to defend free expression. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to Herbert Huncke: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help.

       "  'Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac\\'s concept of \"spontaneous prose\". He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of \"Howl\" he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing \"negro\" and \"angry\" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg\\'s insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry. \\n',\n",

       "  'The inspiration for \"Howl\" was Ginsberg\\'s friend, Carl Solomon, and \"Howl\" is dedicated to Solomon (whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem). Solomon was a Dada and Surrealism enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to Artaud) who suffered bouts of depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy. The institution refused, giving him many forms of therapy, including electroshock therapy. Much of the final section of the first part of \"Howl\" is a description of this.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of \"Moloch\". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a Levantine god to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg\\'s heroes, Dylan Thomas. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg\\'s Jewish background are not infrequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang\\'s film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward. See, for example, Allen Ginsberg, Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Versions, ed. Barry Miles (New York: Harper, 1986), 139â\\x80\\x93140. Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of \"Howl\", which can be seen in the cited pages. Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of postâ\\x80\\x93World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to defy socially created systems of controlâ\\x80\\x94and therefore go against Molochâ\\x80\\x94is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in \"Howl\", such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of \"Howl\" are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a \"best mind\" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg\\'s schizophrenic mother: the line \"with mother finally ****** (fucked)\" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: \"I\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.\" Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write \"Howl\" was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959\\'s \"Kaddish\", which had its first public reading at a Catholic Worker Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with Thomas Merton. \\n',\n",

He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake, the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca.

       "  'Ginsberg also made an intense study of haiku and the paintings of Paul CÃ©zanne, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the Eyeball Kick. He noticed in viewing CÃ©zanne\\'s paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would spasm, or \"kick.\" Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was \"hydrogen jukebox\" (which later became the title of a song cycle composed by Philip Glass with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg\\'s poems). Another example is Ginsberg\\'s observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan\\'s hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, and psychedelics, as a Dexedrine Clown. The phrases \"eyeball kick\" and \"hydrogen jukebox\" both show up in \"Howl\", as well as a direct quote from CÃ©zanne: \"Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus\". \\n',\n",

       "  'From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friendsâ\\x80\\x94not to mention his own experimentsâ\\x80\\x94Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that\\'s easily identified as Ginsbergian. TV interview 1982 Hedwig Gorski and Robert Creeley discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry. Special Robert Creeley issue, Turkey. \"Howl\" came out during a potentially hostile literary environment, less welcoming to non-traditional, free verse poetry; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by New Criticism. Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long, free verse lines, often citing Whitman\\'s free verse used in Leaves of Grass as a precursor. Ginsberg claimed Whitman\\'s long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality. Though some critics, like Diana Trilling, have pointed to Ginsberg\\'s occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of \"who came back to Denver and waited in vain\"), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the \"natural\" poetic voice. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally. Like Williams, Ginsberg\\'s line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in \"Howl\", for example, should be read in one breath. Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Many of Ginsberg\\'s early long line experiments contain some sort of anaphora, repetition of a \"fixed base\" (for example \"who\" in \"Howl\", \"America\" in America) and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg\\'s style. He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust \"free flight\". In the 1960s, after employing it in some sections of \"Kaddish\" (\"caw\" for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric form. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of \"Howl\", each line is in a \"stepped triadic\" format reminiscent of William Carlos Williams. But he abandoned the \"stepped triadic\" when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of The Fall of America. \"Howl\" and \"Kaddish\", arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In America, he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'In \"Howl\" and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the epic, free verse style of the 19th-century American poet Walt Whitman. see Ginsberg, (Deliberate Prose), pp. 285â\\x80\\x93331. Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence. J. D. McClatchy, editor of the Yale Review, called Ginsberg \"the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.\" McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, \"was a bard in the old manner â\\x80\\x93 outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant. His work is finally a history of our era\\'s psyche, with all its contradictory urges.\" \\n',\n",

       "  \"Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov, PhD (, Anatolij Evgen'eviÄ\\x8d Karpov; born May 23, 1951) is a Russian chess grandmaster and former World Champion. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes. However, in his 1994 book \"My Best Games\" Karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches, and won more than 100. He had a peak Elo rating of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is second all-time behind only Garry Kasparov since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Since 2005, he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes, such as advocating the use of iodised salt. Unicef website On December 17, 2012, Karpov supported http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/79982 the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the US.\\n',\n",

       "  '==Early life==\\n',\n",
       "  'Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at Zlatoust in the Urals region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of four. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a Candidate Master by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinnik\\'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: \"The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there\\'s no future at all for him in this profession.\" Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik\\'s tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by Boris Spassky in 1952.\\n',\n",

       "  'Karpov finished first in his first international tournament in TÅ\\x99inec several months later, ahead of Viktor Kupreichik. In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at Groningen. Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered Moscow State University in 1968 to study mathematics. He later transferred to Leningrad State University, eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster Semyon Furman, who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the World Junior Chess Championship, scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at Stockholm. In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in Caracas, Venezuela, and was awarded the grandmaster title.\\n',\n",

His Elo rating shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the USSR Chess Championship, and finished equal first with Viktor Korchnoi in the Leningrad Interzonal Tournament, with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974 Candidates Matches, which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion, Bobby Fischer.\\n',\n",

He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism and sexual repression. Ginsberg is best known for his epic poem \"Howl\", in which he denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States.

His experiences with his mother\\\\\\'s mental illness and her institutionalization are also frequently referred to in \"Howl\". For example, \"Pilgrim State, Rockland, and Grey Stone\\\\\\'s foetid halls\" is a reference to institutions frequented by his mother and Carl Solomon, ostensibly the subject of the poem: Pilgrim State Hospital and Rockland State Hospital in New York and Greystone State Hospital in New Jersey.

This is followed soon by the line \"with mother finally ******.\" Ginsberg later admitted the deletion was the expletive \"fucked.\" Original Draft p. 131. He also says of Solomon in section three, \"I\\\\\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother,\" once again showing the association between Solomon and his mother. Jonah Raskin, American Scream: Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation, pp. 156â\\\\x80\\\\x93157. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg received a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of \"Howl\" he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, \"The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window â\\\\x80\\\\x93 I have the key â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Get married Allen don\\\\\\'t take drugs â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window\". Hyde, pp. 426â\\\\x80\\\\x93427. In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s brother Eugene, she said, \"God\\\\\\'s informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key on the side of the window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window.\" Morgan, Celebrate, pp. 219â\\\\x80\\\\x93220. These letters and the inability to perform the kaddish ceremony inspired Ginsberg to write \"Kaddish\" which makes references to many details from Naomi\\\\\\'s life, Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines \"the key is in the light\" and \"the key is in the window\". Allen Ginsberg. Kaddish and Other Poems. Volume 2, Issue 14 of The Pocket Poets series. City Lights Books, 1961. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===New York Beats===\\\\n\\', \\'In Ginsberg\\\\\\'s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Lucien Carr, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and John Clellon Holmes. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of postâ\\\\x80\\\\x93World War II, McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Arthur Rimbaud) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. Barry Gifford, ed., As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady. In the first chapter of his 1957 novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg\\\\\\'s association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in On the Road. This was a source of strain in their relationship. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Also, in New York, Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso\\\\\\'s poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg\\\\\\'s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Shortly after this period in Ginsberg\\\\\\'s life, he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation\\\\\\'s period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and Come and Join the Dance, which expressed the two women\\\\\\'s experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The Blake Vision===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1948 in an apartment in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the ancient of days\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself xistence itself was God\" and \" felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===San Francisco Renaissance===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met Peter Orlovsky (1933â\\\\x80\\\\x932010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg\\'s mentor William Carlos Williams wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead Kenneth Rexroth, who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College: Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch. In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, Bob Kaufman, A. D. Winans, and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the Beatitude poetry magazine.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Wally Hedrick â\\\\x80\\\\x94 a painter and co-founder of the Six Gallery â\\\\x80\\\\x93 approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery. At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it. Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The Six Gallery reading\" took place on October 7, 1955. The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac\\\\\\'s novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg\\\\\\'s principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco\\\\\\'s City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among defenders of the First Amendment, and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. Ginsberg and Shig Murao, the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends. Ball, Gordon, \"\\\\\\'Howl\\\\\\' and Other Victories: A friend remembers City Lights\\\\\\' Shig Murao,\" San Francisco Chronicle, 11/28/99. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac\\\\\\'s Duluoz Legend). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s life. He begins the poem with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. This madness was the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cangry fixâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that society needed to functionâ\\\\x80\\\\x94madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCarl Solomon! Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m with you in Rocklandâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his â\\\\x80\\\\x9cstraightjacketâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===To Paris and the \"Beat Hotel\"===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco. After a spell in Morocco, he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris. Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue GÃ®t-le-Coeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed Bomb and Marriage, and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together Naked Lunch, from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962â\\\\x80\\\\x933, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay. He lived with the future President of India Pratibha Patil in Varanasi in 1962. Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably Pupul Jayakar who helped him escape imprisonment during the Sino-Indian War.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===England and the International Poetry Incarnation===\\\\n\\', \\'In May 1965, Allen Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free. Nuttall, J: Bomb Culture MacGibbon & Kee, 1968 ISBN 0-261-62617-5 Shortly after his arrival, he gave a reading at Better Books, which was described by Jeff Nuttall as \"the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind\". Tom McGrath wrote \"This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or at least in the history of English Poetry\". Fountain, N: Underground: the London alternative press, 1966â\\\\x80\\\\x9374 page 16. Taylor & Francis, 1988 ISBN 0-415-00728-3 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Soon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the International Poetry Incarnation, which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 11, 1965. The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg, Adrian Mitchell, Alexander Trocchi, Harry Fainlight, Anselm Hollo, Christopher Logue, George Macbeth, Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael Horovitz, Simon Vinkenoog, Spike Hawkins and Tom McGrath.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Peter Whitehead documented the event on film and released it as Wholly Communion. A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Continuing literary activity===\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg with his partner, poet Peter Orlovsky. Photo taken in 1978\\\\n\\', \\'Though the term \"Beat\" is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term \"Beat Generation\" has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include: David Amram, Bob Kaufman; LeRoi Jones before he became Amiri Baraka, who, after reading \"Howl\", wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper; Diane DiPrima; Jim Cohn; poets associated with the Black Mountain College such as Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov; poets associated with the New York School such as Frank O\\\\\\'Hara and Kenneth Koch.\\\\n\\', \\'Portrait with Bob Dylan, taken in 1975\\\\n\\', \\'Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the beat movement of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s, befriending, among others, Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, and Bob Dylan. Ginsberg gave his last public reading at Booksmith, a bookstore in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, a few months before his death. Video of Ginsberg biographer Bill Morgan speaking about the poet. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Buddhism and Krishnaism===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg\\\\\\'s spiritual journey began early on with his spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to India. A chance encounter on a New York City street with ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche (they both tried to catch the same cab), a Kagyu and Nyingma Tibetan Buddhist master, led to Trungpa becoming his friend and lifelong teacher . Ginsberg helped Trungpa (and New York poet Anne Waldman) in founding the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. \"The Beats and Travel\" by David S. Wills \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg was also involved with Krishnaism. He had started incorporating chanting the Hare Krishna mantra into his religious practice in the mid sixties. After learning that A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in the Western world had rented a store front in New York, he befriended him, visiting him often and suggesting publishers for his books, and a fruitful relationship began. This relationship is documented by Satsvarupa Das Goswami in his biographical account Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta. Ginsberg donated money, materials, and his reputation to help the Swami establish the first temple, and toured with him to promote his cause. \\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s greeting Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport. January 17, 1967Despite disagreeing with many of Bhaktivedanta Swami\\\\\\'s required prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly as part of his philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. He was glad that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community. (from the \"Houseboat Summit\" panel discussion, Sausalito CA. February 1967)():\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg: So what do you think of Swami Bhaktivedanta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction?\\\\n\\', \"Snyder: Why, it\\'s a lovely positive thing to say Krishna. It\\'s a beautiful mythology and it\\'s a beautiful practice.\\\\n\", \\'Leary: Should be encouraged.\\\\n\\', \"Ginsberg: He feels it\\'s the one uniting thing. He feels a monopolistic unitary thing about it.\\\\n\", \"Watts: I\\'ll tell you why I think he feels it. The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association. ... hen somebody comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn\\'t got any of associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, and we can get with that, you see, and we can dig that! \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On January 17, 1967, Allen Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport, where fifty to a hundred hippies greeted the Swami, chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands. Addressing speculations that he was Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s guru, Bhaktivedanta Swami answered a direct question in a public program, \"Are you Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s guru?\" by saying, \"I am nobodyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s guru. I am everybodyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s servant. Actually I am not even a servant; a servant of God is no ordinary thing.\" (; ) To further support and promote Bhaktivendata Swami\\\\\\'s message and chanting in San Francisco, Allen Ginsberg agreed to attend the Mantra-Rock Danceâ\\\\x80\\\\x94a musical event held at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. It featured some leading rock bands of the time: Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and Moby Grape, who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple. Ginsberg introduced Bhaktivedanta Swami to some three thousand hippies in the audience and led the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Mantra-Rock Dance promotional poster featuring Allen Ginsberg along with leading rock bands.Music and chanting were both important parts of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s live delivery during poetry readings. Chowka, Peter Barry, \"This is Allen Ginsberg?\" (Interview), New Age Journal, April 1976. \"I had known Swami Bhaktivedanta and was somewhat guided by him... spiritual friend. I practiced the Hare Krishna chant, practiced it with him, sometimes in mass auditoriums and parks in the Lower East Side of New York. Actually, I\\\\\\'d been chanting it since \\\\\\'63, after coming back from India. I began chanting it, in Vancouver at a great poetry conference, for the first time in \\\\\\'63, with Duncan and Olson and everybody around, and then continued. When Bhaktivedanta arrived on the Lower East Side in \\\\\\'66 it was reinforcement for me, like \\\\\\'the reinforcements had arrived\\\\\\' from India.\" He often accompanied himself on a harmonium, and was often accompanied by a guitarist. When Ginsberg asked if he could sing a song in praise of Lord Krishna on William F. Buckley, Jr.\\\\\\'s TV show Firing Line on September 3, 1968, Buckley acceded and the poet chanted slowly as he played dolefully on a harmonium.

In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing \"Howl\". At the time, such \"sex talk\" employed in \"Howl\" was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law. Raskin, Jonah. American Scream:Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation. California: University of California Press (2004). Ginsberg used phrases such as \"cocksucker\", \"fucked in the ass\", and \"cunt\" as part of the poem\\\\\\'s depiction of different aspects of American culture. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including Lady Chatterleyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Lover. The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even long time lovers. Instead, Ginsberg portrayed casual sex, and used this to comment on the emptiness and constant hunger that could exist in the lives of Americans. For example, in \"Howl\", Ginsberg praises the man \"who sweetened the snatches of a million girls\". Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man \"who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup.\" In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality. The explicit sexual language that filled \"Howl\" eventually led to an important trial on First Amendment issues. Ginsberg\\\\\\'s publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges because the poem carried \"redeeming social importance\", Ed. Bill Morgan. \"Howl\" on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression. California: City of Lights (2006). thus setting an important legal precedent. Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 1970-1996, Ginsberg had a long-term affiliation with PEN American Center with efforts to defend free expression. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to Herbert Huncke: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help.

He admired Castro and many other quasi-Marxist figures from the 20th century. In \"America\" (1956), Ginsberg writes: \"America, I used to be a communist when I was a kid I\\\\\\'m not sorry....\" Biographer Jonah Raskin has claimed that, despite his often stark opposition to communist orthodoxy, Ginsberg held \"his own idiosyncratic version of communism\". Raskin, 170. On the other hand, when Donald Manes, a New York City politician, publicly accused Ginsberg of being a member of the Communist Party, Ginsberg objected: \"I am not, as a matter of fact, a member of the Communist party, nor am I dedicated to the overthrow of U.S. government or any government by violence.... I must say that I see little difference between the armed and violent governments both Communist and Capitalist that I have observed ...\" Ginsberg The Letters of Allen Ginsberg (Philadelphia, Da Capo Press, 2008), p. 359.

He claimed that communist countries, such as China, welcomed him because they thought he was an enemy of capitalism, but often turned against him when they saw him as a trouble maker. For example, in 1965 Ginsberg was deported from Cuba for publicly protesting at the persecution of homosexuals and referring to Che Guevara as \"cute\".

VÃ¡clav Havel points to Ginsberg as an important inspiration in striving for freedom. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Gay rights===\\\\n\\', \\'One contribution that is often considered his most significant and most controversial was his openness about homosexuality. Ginsberg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people. In 1943, he discovered within himself \"mountains of homosexuality.\" He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry. He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong companion, as his spouse in his Who\\\\\\'s Who entry. Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent, he challengedâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and ultimately changedâ\\\\x80\\\\x94obscenity laws. He was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscenity laws (William S. Burroughs and Lenny Bruce, for example).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Association with NAMBLA===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg was a supporter and member of North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). In \"Thoughts on NAMBLA\", a 1994 essay published in the collection Deliberate Prose, Ginsberg stated, \"I joined NAMBLA in defense of free speech.\" He referred to NAMBLA \"as a forum for reform of those laws on youthful sexuality which members deem oppressive, a discussion society not a sex club.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Demystification of drugs===\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg also talked often about drug use. Throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the demystification of LSD, and, with Timothy Leary, worked to promote its common use. He was also for many decades an advocate of marijuana legalization, and, at the same time, warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his Put Down Your Cigarette Rag (Don\\\\\\'t Smoke): \"Don\\\\\\'t Smoke Don\\\\\\'t Smoke Nicotine Nicotine No / No don\\\\\\'t smoke the official Dope Smoke Dope Dope.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'=== CIA drug trafficking===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Through his own drug use, and the drug use of his friends and associates, Ginsberg became more and more preoccupied with the American government\\\\\\'s relationship to drug use within and outside the nation. He worked closely with Alfred W. McCoy who was writing The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia which tracked the history of the American government\\\\\\'s involvement in illegal opium dealing around the world. This would affirm Ginsberg\\\\\\'s suspicions that the government and the CIA were involved in drug trafficking. In addition to working with McCoy, Ginsberg personally confronted Richard Helms, the director of the CIA in the 1970s, but he was simply brushed off as being \"full of beans\". Allen wrote many essays and articles, researching and compiling evidence of CIA\\\\\\'s involvement, but it would take ten years, and the publication of McCoy\\\\\\'s book in 1972, before anyone took him seriously. In 1978 Allen received a note from the chief editor of the New York Times, apologizing for not taking his allegations seriously so many years previous. I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin, 2006. ISBN 978-0-14-311249-5, p. 470-477. The political subject is dealt with in the song/poem \"CIA Dope calypso\".\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Work==\\\\n\\', \\'Though early on Ginsberg had intentions to be a labor lawyer, he wrote poetry for most of his life. Most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol William Blake. His admiration for the writing of Jack Kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously. Though he took odd jobs to support himself, in 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry. Soon after, he wrote \"Howl\", the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life. Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at Brooklyn College from 1986 until his death.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Inspiration from friends===\\\\n\\', \"Since Ginsberg\\'s poetry is intensely personal, and since much of the vitality of those associated with the beat generation comes from mutual inspiration, much credit for style, inspiration, and content can be given to Ginsberg\\'s friends.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac\\\\\\'s concept of \"spontaneous prose\". He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of \"Howl\" he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing \"negro\" and \"angry\" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg\\\\\\'s insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The inspiration for \"Howl\" was Ginsberg\\\\\\'s friend, Carl Solomon, and \"Howl\" is dedicated to Solomon (whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem). Solomon was a Dada and Surrealism enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to Artaud) who suffered bouts of depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy. The institution refused, giving him many forms of therapy, including electroshock therapy. Much of the final section of the first part of \"Howl\" is a description of this.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of \"Moloch\". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a Levantine god to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s heroes, Dylan Thomas. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s Jewish background are not infrequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang\\\\\\'s film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward. See, for example, Allen Ginsberg, Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Versions, ed. Barry Miles (New York: Harper, 1986), 139â\\\\x80\\\\x93140. Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of \"Howl\", which can be seen in the cited pages. Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of postâ\\\\x80\\\\x93World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to defy socially created systems of controlâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and therefore go against Molochâ\\\\x80\\\\x94is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in \"Howl\", such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of \"Howl\" are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a \"best mind\" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg\\\\\\'s schizophrenic mother: the line \"with mother finally ****** (fucked)\" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: \"I\\\\\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.\" Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write \"Howl\" was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959\\\\\\'s \"Kaddish\", which had its first public reading at a Catholic Worker Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with Thomas Merton. \\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Inspiration from mentors and idols===\\\\n\\', \"Ginsberg\\'s poetry was strongly influenced by Modernism (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams), Romanticism (specifically William Blake and John Keats), the beat and cadence of jazz (specifically that of bop musicians such as Charlie Parker), and his Kagyu Buddhist practice and Jewish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake, the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca. The power of Ginsberg\\'s verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its New World exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed. Ginsberg, Allen. Spontaneous Mind: Selected Interviews, 1958â\\\\x80\\\\x931996. Harper Perennial, 2002. ISBN 0-06-093082-9 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'He corresponded with William Carlos Williams, who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem Paterson about the industrial city near his home. After attending a reading by Williams, Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter. Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like \"thee.\" Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg, \"In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Though he disliked these early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg\\\\\\'s letter. He included the letter in a later part of Paterson. He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams\\\\\\' own motto \"No ideas but in things.\" Studying Williams\\\\\\' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style. Early breakthrough poems include Bricklayer\\\\\\'s Lunch Hour and Dream Record. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (To Have Done with the Judgement of God and Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society), and Jean Genet (Our Lady of the Flowers). Philip Lamantia introduced him to other Surrealists and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of \"Kaddish\" were inspired by AndrÃ© Breton\\\\\\'s Free Union). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of \"Howl\" and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as Jubilate Agno. Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as: Franz Kafka, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Edgar Allan Poe, and even Emily Dickinson. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg also made an intense study of haiku and the paintings of Paul CÃ©zanne, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the Eyeball Kick. He noticed in viewing CÃ©zanne\\\\\\'s paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would spasm, or \"kick.\" Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was \"hydrogen jukebox\" (which later became the title of a song cycle composed by Philip Glass with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg\\\\\\'s poems). Another example is Ginsberg\\\\\\'s observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan\\\\\\'s hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, and psychedelics, as a Dexedrine Clown. The phrases \"eyeball kick\" and \"hydrogen jukebox\" both show up in \"Howl\", as well as a direct quote from CÃ©zanne: \"Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus\". \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Style and technique===\\\\n\\', \\'From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friendsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94not to mention his own experimentsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that\\\\\\'s easily identified as Ginsbergian. TV interview 1982 Hedwig Gorski and Robert Creeley discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry. Special Robert Creeley issue, Turkey. \"Howl\" came out during a potentially hostile literary environment, less welcoming to non-traditional, free verse poetry; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by New Criticism. Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long, free verse lines, often citing Whitman\\\\\\'s free verse used in Leaves of Grass as a precursor. Ginsberg claimed Whitman\\\\\\'s long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality. Though some critics, like Diana Trilling, have pointed to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of \"who came back to Denver and waited in vain\"), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the \"natural\" poetic voice. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally. Like Williams, Ginsberg\\\\\\'s line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in \"Howl\", for example, should be read in one breath. Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Many of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s early long line experiments contain some sort of anaphora, repetition of a \"fixed base\" (for example \"who\" in \"Howl\", \"America\" in America) and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s style. He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust \"free flight\". In the 1960s, after employing it in some sections of \"Kaddish\" (\"caw\" for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric form. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of \"Howl\", each line is in a \"stepped triadic\" format reminiscent of William Carlos Williams. But he abandoned the \"stepped triadic\" when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of The Fall of America. \"Howl\" and \"Kaddish\", arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In America, he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In \"Howl\" and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the epic, free verse style of the 19th-century American poet Walt Whitman. see Ginsberg, (Deliberate Prose), pp. 285â\\\\x80\\\\x93331. Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence. J. D. McClatchy, editor of the Yale Review, called Ginsberg \"the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.\" McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, \"was a bard in the old manner â\\\\x80\\\\x93 outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant.

The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed. Also, no finite field F is algebraically closed, because if a1, a2, â\\\\x80¦, an are the elements of F, then the polynomial (x &minus; a1)(x &minus; a2) Â·Â·Â· (x &minus; a\\'n) + 1\\\\n\", \\'has no zero in F. By contrast, the fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) algebraic numbers.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Equivalent properties==\\\\n\\', \\'Given a field F, the assertion â\\\\x80\\\\x9cF is algebraically closedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is equivalent to other assertions:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if the only irreducible polynomials in the polynomial ring F are those of degree one.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The assertion â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe polynomials of degree one are irreducibleâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is trivially true for any field. If F is algebraically closed and p(x) is an irreducible polynomial of F, then it has some root a and therefore p(x) is a multiple of x &minus; a. Since p(x) is irreducible, this means that p(x) = k(x &minus; a), for some k â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F \\\\\\\\ {0}. On the other hand, if F is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial p(x) in F without roots in F. Let q(x) be some irreducible factor of p(x). Since p(x) has no roots in F, q(x) also has no roots in F. Therefore, q(x) has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in F.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomials===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial p(x) of degree n â\\\\x89¥ 1, with coefficients in F, splits into linear factors. In other words, there are elements k, x1, x2, â\\\\x80¦, xn of the field F such that p(x) = k(x &minus; x1)(x &minus; x2) Â·Â·Â· (x &minus; xn).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F has this property, then clearly every non-constant polynomial in F has some root in F; in other words, F is algebraically closed. On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for F if F is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field K, any polynomial in K can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Polynomials of prime degree have roots===\\\\n\\', \\'J. Shipman showed in 2007 that if every polynomial over F of prime degree has a root in F, then every non-constant polynomial has a root in F, thus F is algebraically closed.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The field has no proper algebraic extension===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper algebraic extension.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F has no proper algebraic extension, let p(x) be some irreducible polynomial in F. Then the quotient of F modulo the ideal generated by p(x) is an algebraic extension of F whose degree is equal to the degree of p(x). Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of p(x) is 1.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On the other hand, if F has some proper algebraic extension K, then the minimal polynomial of an element in K \\\\\\\\ F is irreducible and its degree is greater than 1.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The field has no proper finite extension===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite algebraic extension because if, within the previous proof, the word â\\\\x80\\\\x9calgebraicâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is replaced by the word â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfiniteâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, then the proof is still valid.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvector===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if, for each natural number n, every linear map from Fn into itself has some eigenvector.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"An endomorphism of Fn has an eigenvector if and only if its characteristic polynomial has some root. Therefore, when F is algebraically closed, every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvector. On the other hand, if every endomorphism of Fn has an eigenvector, let p(x) be an element of F. Dividing by its leading coefficient, we get another polynomial q(x) which has roots if and only if p(x) has roots. But if q(x) = xn + a\\'n &minus; 1x\\'n &minus; 1+ Â·Â·Â· + a0, then q(x) is the characteristic polynomial of the companion matrix\\\\n\", \\':\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Decomposition of rational expressions===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every rational function in one variable x, with coefficients in F, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form a/(x &minus; b)n, where n is a natural number, and a and b are elements of F.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in F are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the theorem on partial fraction decomposition.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field F. Let p(x) be an irreducible element in F. Then the rational function 1/p can be written as the sum of a polynomial function q with rational functions of the form a/(x &minus; b)n. Therefore, the rational expression\\\\n\\', \\':\\\\n\\', \\'can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since p(x) is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Relatively prime polynomials and roots===\\\\n\\', \\'For any field F, if two polynomials p(x),q(x) â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F are relatively prime then they do not have a common root, for if a â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F was a common root, then p(x) and q(x) would both be multiples of x &minus; a and therefore they would not be relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime) are precisely the algebraically closed fields.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If the field F is algebraically closed, let p(x) and q(x) be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let r(x) be their greatest common divisor. Then, since r(x) is not constant, it will have some root a, which will be then a common root of p(x) and q(x).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F is not algebraically closed, let p(x) be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then p(x) and p(x) are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots (since none of them has roots).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Other properties==\\\\n\\', \\'If F is an algebraically closed field and n is a natural number, then F contains all nth roots of unity, because these are (by definition) the n (not necessarily distinct) zeroes of the polynomial xn &minus; 1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a cyclotomic extension, and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its cyclotomic closure. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form xn &minus; a splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of first-order logic is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same characteristic. Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic 0, but there is some natural number N such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic p when p &gt; N.

He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE\\'s new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world\\'s elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes. However, in his 1994 book \"My Best Games\" Karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches, and won more than 100. He had a peak Elo rating of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is second all-time behind only Garry Kasparov since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Since 2005, he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes, such as advocating the use of iodised salt. Unicef website On December 17, 2012, Karpov supported http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/79982 the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the US.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Early life==\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at Zlatoust in the Urals region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of four. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a Candidate Master by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinnik\\\\\\'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: \"The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there\\\\\\'s no future at all for him in this profession.\" Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik\\\\\\'s tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by Boris Spassky in 1952.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==International career==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Young master===\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov finished first in his first international tournament in TÅ\\\\x99inec several months later, ahead of Viktor Kupreichik. In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at Groningen. Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered Moscow State University in 1968 to study mathematics. He later transferred to Leningrad State University, eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster Semyon Furman, who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the World Junior Chess Championship, scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at Stockholm. In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in Caracas, Venezuela, and was awarded the grandmaster title.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Top-Class Grandmaster===\\\\n\\', \\'He won the 1971 Alekhine Memorial in Moscow (equal with Leonid Stein), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His Elo rating shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the USSR Chess Championship, and finished equal first with Viktor Korchnoi in the Leningrad Interzonal Tournament, with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974 Candidates Matches, which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion, Bobby Fischer.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\']'"

This is followed soon by the line \"with mother finally ******.\" Ginsberg later admitted the deletion was the expletive \"fucked.\" Original Draft p. 131. He also says of Solomon in section three, \"I\\\\\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother,\" once again showing the association between Solomon and his mother. Jonah Raskin, American Scream: Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation, pp. 156â\\\\x80\\\\x93157. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg received a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of \"Howl\" he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, \"The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window â\\\\x80\\\\x93 I have the key â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Get married Allen don\\\\\\'t take drugs â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window\". Hyde, pp. 426â\\\\x80\\\\x93427. In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s brother Eugene, she said, \"God\\\\\\'s informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key on the side of the window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window.\" Morgan, Celebrate, pp. 219â\\\\x80\\\\x93220. These letters and the inability to perform the kaddish ceremony inspired Ginsberg to write \"Kaddish\" which makes references to many details from Naomi\\\\\\'s life, Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines \"the key is in the light\" and \"the key is in the window\". Allen Ginsberg. Kaddish and Other Poems. Volume 2, Issue 14 of The Pocket Poets series. City Lights Books, 1961. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===New York Beats===\\\\n\\', \\'In Ginsberg\\\\\\'s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Lucien Carr, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and John Clellon Holmes. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of postâ\\\\x80\\\\x93World War II, McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Arthur Rimbaud) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. Barry Gifford, ed., As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady. In the first chapter of his 1957 novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg\\\\\\'s association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in On the Road. This was a source of strain in their relationship. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Also, in New York, Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso\\\\\\'s poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg\\\\\\'s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Shortly after this period in Ginsberg\\\\\\'s life, he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation\\\\\\'s period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and Come and Join the Dance, which expressed the two women\\\\\\'s experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The Blake Vision===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1948 in an apartment in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the ancient of days\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself xistence itself was God\" and \" felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===San Francisco Renaissance===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met Peter Orlovsky (1933â\\\\x80\\\\x932010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg\\'s mentor William Carlos Williams wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead Kenneth Rexroth, who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College: Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch. In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, Bob Kaufman, A. D. Winans, and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the Beatitude poetry magazine.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Wally Hedrick â\\\\x80\\\\x94 a painter and co-founder of the Six Gallery â\\\\x80\\\\x93 approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery. At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it. Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The Six Gallery reading\" took place on October 7, 1955. The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac\\\\\\'s novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg\\\\\\'s principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco\\\\\\'s City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among defenders of the First Amendment, and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. Ginsberg and Shig Murao, the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends. Ball, Gordon, \"\\\\\\'Howl\\\\\\' and Other Victories: A friend remembers City Lights\\\\\\' Shig Murao,\" San Francisco Chronicle, 11/28/99. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac\\\\\\'s Duluoz Legend). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s life. He begins the poem with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. This madness was the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cangry fixâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that society needed to functionâ\\\\x80\\\\x94madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCarl Solomon! Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m with you in Rocklandâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his â\\\\x80\\\\x9cstraightjacketâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===To Paris and the \"Beat Hotel\"===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco. After a spell in Morocco, he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris. Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue GÃ®t-le-Coeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed Bomb and Marriage, and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together Naked Lunch, from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962â\\\\x80\\\\x933, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay. He lived with the future President of India Pratibha Patil in Varanasi in 1962. Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably Pupul Jayakar who helped him escape imprisonment during the Sino-Indian War.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===England and the International Poetry Incarnation===\\\\n\\', \\'In May 1965, Allen Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free. Nuttall, J: Bomb Culture MacGibbon & Kee, 1968 ISBN 0-261-62617-5 Shortly after his arrival, he gave a reading at Better Books, which was described by Jeff Nuttall as \"the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind\". Tom McGrath wrote \"This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or at least in the history of English Poetry\".

The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg, Adrian Mitchell, Alexander Trocchi, Harry Fainlight, Anselm Hollo, Christopher Logue, George Macbeth, Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael Horovitz, Simon Vinkenoog, Spike Hawkins and Tom McGrath.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Peter Whitehead documented the event on film and released it as Wholly Communion. A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Continuing literary activity===\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg with his partner, poet Peter Orlovsky. Photo taken in 1978\\\\n\\', \\'Though the term \"Beat\" is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term \"Beat Generation\" has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include: David Amram, Bob Kaufman; LeRoi Jones before he became Amiri Baraka, who, after reading \"Howl\", wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper; Diane DiPrima; Jim Cohn; poets associated with the Black Mountain College such as Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov; poets associated with the New York School such as Frank O\\\\\\'Hara and Kenneth Koch.\\\\n\\', \\'Portrait with Bob Dylan, taken in 1975\\\\n\\', \\'Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the beat movement of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s, befriending, among others, Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, and Bob Dylan. Ginsberg gave his last public reading at Booksmith, a bookstore in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, a few months before his death. Video of Ginsberg biographer Bill Morgan speaking about the poet. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Buddhism and Krishnaism===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg\\\\\\'s spiritual journey began early on with his spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to India. A chance encounter on a New York City street with ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche (they both tried to catch the same cab), a Kagyu and Nyingma Tibetan Buddhist master, led to Trungpa becoming his friend and lifelong teacher . Ginsberg helped Trungpa (and New York poet Anne Waldman) in founding the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. \"The Beats and Travel\" by David S. Wills \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg was also involved with Krishnaism. He had started incorporating chanting the Hare Krishna mantra into his religious practice in the mid sixties. After learning that A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in the Western world had rented a store front in New York, he befriended him, visiting him often and suggesting publishers for his books, and a fruitful relationship began. This relationship is documented by Satsvarupa Das Goswami in his biographical account Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta. Ginsberg donated money, materials, and his reputation to help the Swami establish the first temple, and toured with him to promote his cause. \\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s greeting Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport. January 17, 1967Despite disagreeing with many of Bhaktivedanta Swami\\\\\\'s required prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly as part of his philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. He was glad that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community. (from the \"Houseboat Summit\" panel discussion, Sausalito CA. February 1967)():\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg: So what do you think of Swami Bhaktivedanta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction?\\\\n\\', \"Snyder: Why, it\\'s a lovely positive thing to say Krishna. It\\'s a beautiful mythology and it\\'s a beautiful practice.\\\\n\", \\'Leary: Should be encouraged.\\\\n\\', \"Ginsberg: He feels it\\'s the one uniting thing. He feels a monopolistic unitary thing about it.\\\\n\", \"Watts: I\\'ll tell you why I think he feels it. The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association. ... hen somebody comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn\\'t got any of associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, and we can get with that, you see, and we can dig that! \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On January 17, 1967, Allen Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport, where fifty to a hundred hippies greeted the Swami, chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands. Addressing speculations that he was Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s guru, Bhaktivedanta Swami answered a direct question in a public program, \"Are you Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s guru?\" by saying, \"I am nobodyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s guru. I am everybodyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s servant. Actually I am not even a servant; a servant of God is no ordinary thing.\" (; ) To further support and promote Bhaktivendata Swami\\\\\\'s message and chanting in San Francisco, Allen Ginsberg agreed to attend the Mantra-Rock Danceâ\\\\x80\\\\x94a musical event held at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. It featured some leading rock bands of the time: Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and Moby Grape, who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple. Ginsberg introduced Bhaktivedanta Swami to some three thousand hippies in the audience and led the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Mantra-Rock Dance promotional poster featuring Allen Ginsberg along with leading rock bands.Music and chanting were both important parts of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s live delivery during poetry readings.

I practiced the Hare Krishna chant, practiced it with him, sometimes in mass auditoriums and parks in the Lower East Side of New York.

In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing \"Howl\". At the time, such \"sex talk\" employed in \"Howl\" was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law. Raskin, Jonah. American Scream:Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation. California: University of California Press (2004). Ginsberg used phrases such as \"cocksucker\", \"fucked in the ass\", and \"cunt\" as part of the poem\\\\\\'s depiction of different aspects of American culture. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including Lady Chatterleyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Lover. The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even long time lovers. Instead, Ginsberg portrayed casual sex, and used this to comment on the emptiness and constant hunger that could exist in the lives of Americans. For example, in \"Howl\", Ginsberg praises the man \"who sweetened the snatches of a million girls\". Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man \"who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup.\" In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality. The explicit sexual language that filled \"Howl\" eventually led to an important trial on First Amendment issues. Ginsberg\\\\\\'s publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges because the poem carried \"redeeming social importance\", Ed. Bill Morgan. \"Howl\" on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression. California: City of Lights (2006). thus setting an important legal precedent. Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 1970-1996, Ginsberg had a long-term affiliation with PEN American Center with efforts to defend free expression. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to Herbert Huncke: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help.

Ginsberg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people. In 1943, he discovered within himself \"mountains of homosexuality.\" He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry. He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong companion, as his spouse in his Who\\\\\\'s Who entry. Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent, he challengedâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and ultimately changedâ\\\\x80\\\\x94obscenity laws. He was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscenity laws (William S. Burroughs and Lenny Bruce, for example).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Association with NAMBLA===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg was a supporter and member of North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). In \"Thoughts on NAMBLA\", a 1994 essay published in the collection Deliberate Prose, Ginsberg stated, \"I joined NAMBLA in defense of free speech.\" He referred to NAMBLA \"as a forum for reform of those laws on youthful sexuality which members deem oppressive, a discussion society not a sex club.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Demystification of drugs===\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg also talked often about drug use. Throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the demystification of LSD, and, with Timothy Leary, worked to promote its common use. He was also for many decades an advocate of marijuana legalization, and, at the same time, warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his Put Down Your Cigarette Rag (Don\\\\\\'t Smoke): \"Don\\\\\\'t Smoke Don\\\\\\'t Smoke Nicotine Nicotine No / No don\\\\\\'t smoke the official Dope Smoke Dope Dope.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'=== CIA drug trafficking===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Through his own drug use, and the drug use of his friends and associates, Ginsberg became more and more preoccupied with the American government\\\\\\'s relationship to drug use within and outside the nation. He worked closely with Alfred W. McCoy who was writing The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia which tracked the history of the American government\\\\\\'s involvement in illegal opium dealing around the world. This would affirm Ginsberg\\\\\\'s suspicions that the government and the CIA were involved in drug trafficking. In addition to working with McCoy, Ginsberg personally confronted Richard Helms, the director of the CIA in the 1970s, but he was simply brushed off as being \"full of beans\". Allen wrote many essays and articles, researching and compiling evidence of CIA\\\\\\'s involvement, but it would take ten years, and the publication of McCoy\\\\\\'s book in 1972, before anyone took him seriously. In 1978 Allen received a note from the chief editor of the New York Times, apologizing for not taking his allegations seriously so many years previous. I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin, 2006. ISBN 978-0-14-311249-5, p. 470-477. The political subject is dealt with in the song/poem \"CIA Dope calypso\".\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Work==\\\\n\\', \\'Though early on Ginsberg had intentions to be a labor lawyer, he wrote poetry for most of his life. Most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol William Blake. His admiration for the writing of Jack Kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously. Though he took odd jobs to support himself, in 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry. Soon after, he wrote \"Howl\", the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life. Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at Brooklyn College from 1986 until his death.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Inspiration from friends===\\\\n\\', \"Since Ginsberg\\'s poetry is intensely personal, and since much of the vitality of those associated with the beat generation comes from mutual inspiration, much credit for style, inspiration, and content can be given to Ginsberg\\'s friends.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac\\\\\\'s concept of \"spontaneous prose\". He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of \"Howl\" he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing \"negro\" and \"angry\" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg\\\\\\'s insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The inspiration for \"Howl\" was Ginsberg\\\\\\'s friend, Carl Solomon, and \"Howl\" is dedicated to Solomon (whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem). Solomon was a Dada and Surrealism enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to Artaud) who suffered bouts of depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy. The institution refused, giving him many forms of therapy, including electroshock therapy. Much of the final section of the first part of \"Howl\" is a description of this.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of \"Moloch\". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a Levantine god to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s heroes, Dylan Thomas. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s Jewish background are not infrequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang\\\\\\'s film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward. See, for example, Allen Ginsberg, Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Versions, ed. Barry Miles (New York: Harper, 1986), 139â\\\\x80\\\\x93140. Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of \"Howl\", which can be seen in the cited pages. Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of postâ\\\\x80\\\\x93World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to defy socially created systems of controlâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and therefore go against Molochâ\\\\x80\\\\x94is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in \"Howl\", such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of \"Howl\" are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a \"best mind\" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg\\\\\\'s schizophrenic mother: the line \"with mother finally ****** (fucked)\" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: \"I\\\\\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.\" Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write \"Howl\" was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959\\\\\\'s \"Kaddish\", which had its first public reading at a Catholic Worker Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with Thomas Merton. \\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Inspiration from mentors and idols===\\\\n\\', \"Ginsberg\\'s poetry was strongly influenced by Modernism (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams), Romanticism (specifically William Blake and John Keats), the beat and cadence of jazz (specifically that of bop musicians such as Charlie Parker), and his Kagyu Buddhist practice and Jewish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake, the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca. The power of Ginsberg\\'s verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its New World exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed.

ISBN 0-06-093082-9 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'He corresponded with William Carlos Williams, who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem Paterson about the industrial city near his home. After attending a reading by Williams, Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter. Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like \"thee.\" Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg, \"In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Though he disliked these early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg\\\\\\'s letter. He included the letter in a later part of Paterson. He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams\\\\\\' own motto \"No ideas but in things.\" Studying Williams\\\\\\' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style. Early breakthrough poems include Bricklayer\\\\\\'s Lunch Hour and Dream Record. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (To Have Done with the Judgement of God and Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society), and Jean Genet (Our Lady of the Flowers). Philip Lamantia introduced him to other Surrealists and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of \"Kaddish\" were inspired by AndrÃ© Breton\\\\\\'s Free Union). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of \"Howl\" and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as Jubilate Agno. Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as: Franz Kafka, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Edgar Allan Poe, and even Emily Dickinson. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg also made an intense study of haiku and the paintings of Paul CÃ©zanne, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the Eyeball Kick. He noticed in viewing CÃ©zanne\\\\\\'s paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would spasm, or \"kick.\" Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was \"hydrogen jukebox\" (which later became the title of a song cycle composed by Philip Glass with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg\\\\\\'s poems). Another example is Ginsberg\\\\\\'s observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan\\\\\\'s hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, and psychedelics, as a Dexedrine Clown. The phrases \"eyeball kick\" and \"hydrogen jukebox\" both show up in \"Howl\", as well as a direct quote from CÃ©zanne: \"Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus\". \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Style and technique===\\\\n\\', \\'From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friendsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94not to mention his own experimentsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that\\\\\\'s easily identified as Ginsbergian. TV interview 1982 Hedwig Gorski and Robert Creeley discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry. Special Robert Creeley issue, Turkey. \"Howl\" came out during a potentially hostile literary environment, less welcoming to non-traditional, free verse poetry; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by New Criticism. Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long, free verse lines, often citing Whitman\\\\\\'s free verse used in Leaves of Grass as a precursor. Ginsberg claimed Whitman\\\\\\'s long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality. Though some critics, like Diana Trilling, have pointed to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of \"who came back to Denver and waited in vain\"), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the \"natural\" poetic voice. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally. Like Williams, Ginsberg\\\\\\'s line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in \"Howl\", for example, should be read in one breath. Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Many of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s early long line experiments contain some sort of anaphora, repetition of a \"fixed base\" (for example \"who\" in \"Howl\", \"America\" in America) and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s style. He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust \"free flight\". In the 1960s, after employing it in some sections of \"Kaddish\" (\"caw\" for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric form. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of \"Howl\", each line is in a \"stepped triadic\" format reminiscent of William Carlos Williams. But he abandoned the \"stepped triadic\" when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of The Fall of America. \"Howl\" and \"Kaddish\", arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In America, he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In \"Howl\" and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the epic, free verse style of the 19th-century American poet Walt Whitman. see Ginsberg, (Deliberate Prose), pp. 285â\\\\x80\\\\x93331. Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence. J. D. McClatchy, editor of the Yale Review, called Ginsberg \"the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.\" McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, \"was a bard in the old manner â\\\\x80\\\\x93 outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant. His work is finally a history of our era\\\\\\'s psyche, with all its contradictory urges.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Bibliography==\\\\n\\', \\'right\\\\n\\', \\'* Howl and Other Poems (1956) ISBN 978-0-87286-017-9\\\\n\\', \\'* Kaddish and Other Poems (1961) ISBN 978-0-87286-019-3\\\\n\\', \\'* (1961)\\\\n\\', \\'* Reality Sandwiches (1963) ISBN 978-0-87286-021-6\\\\n\\', \\'* The Yage Letters (1963) â\\\\x80\\\\x93 with William S.

The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed. Also, no finite field F is algebraically closed, because if a1, a2, â\\\\x80¦, an are the elements of F, then the polynomial (x &minus; a1)(x &minus; a2) Â·Â·Â· (x &minus; a\\'n) + 1\\\\n\", \\'has no zero in F. By contrast, the fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) algebraic numbers.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Equivalent properties==\\\\n\\', \\'Given a field F, the assertion â\\\\x80\\\\x9cF is algebraically closedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is equivalent to other assertions:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if the only irreducible polynomials in the polynomial ring F are those of degree one.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The assertion â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe polynomials of degree one are irreducibleâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is trivially true for any field. If F is algebraically closed and p(x) is an irreducible polynomial of F, then it has some root a and therefore p(x) is a multiple of x &minus; a. Since p(x) is irreducible, this means that p(x) = k(x &minus; a), for some k â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F \\\\\\\\ {0}. On the other hand, if F is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial p(x) in F without roots in F. Let q(x) be some irreducible factor of p(x). Since p(x) has no roots in F, q(x) also has no roots in F.

Let p(x) be an irreducible element in F. Then the rational function 1/p can be written as the sum of a polynomial function q with rational functions of the form a/(x &minus; b)n. Therefore, the rational expression\\\\n\\', \\':\\\\n\\', \\'can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since p(x) is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Relatively prime polynomials and roots===\\\\n\\', \\'For any field F, if two polynomials p(x),q(x) â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F are relatively prime then they do not have a common root, for if a â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F was a common root, then p(x) and q(x) would both be multiples of x &minus; a and therefore they would not be relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime) are precisely the algebraically closed fields.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If the field F is algebraically closed, let p(x) and q(x) be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let r(x) be their greatest common divisor. Then, since r(x) is not constant, it will have some root a, which will be then a common root of p(x) and q(x).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F is not algebraically closed, let p(x) be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then p(x) and p(x) are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots (since none of them has roots).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Other properties==\\\\n\\', \\'If F is an algebraically closed field and n is a natural number, then F contains all nth roots of unity, because these are (by definition) the n (not necessarily distinct) zeroes of the polynomial xn &minus; 1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a cyclotomic extension, and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its cyclotomic closure. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form xn &minus; a splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of first-order logic is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same characteristic. Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic 0, but there is some natural number N such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic p when p &gt; N.

He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE\\'s new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world\\'s elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes. However, in his 1994 book \"My Best Games\" Karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches, and won more than 100. He had a peak Elo rating of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is second all-time behind only Garry Kasparov since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Since 2005, he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes, such as advocating the use of iodised salt. Unicef website On December 17, 2012, Karpov supported http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/79982 the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the US.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Early life==\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at Zlatoust in the Urals region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of four. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a Candidate Master by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinnik\\\\\\'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: \"The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there\\\\\\'s no future at all for him in this profession.\" Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik\\\\\\'s tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by Boris Spassky in 1952.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==International career==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Young master===\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov finished first in his first international tournament in TÅ\\\\x99inec several months later, ahead of Viktor Kupreichik. In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at Groningen. Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered Moscow State University in 1968 to study mathematics. He later transferred to Leningrad State University, eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster Semyon Furman, who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the World Junior Chess Championship, scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at Stockholm. In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in Caracas, Venezuela, and was awarded the grandmaster title.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Top-Class Grandmaster===\\\\n\\', \\'He won the 1971 Alekhine Memorial in Moscow (equal with Leonid Stein), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His Elo rating shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the USSR Chess Championship, and finished equal first with Viktor Korchnoi in the Leningrad Interzonal Tournament, with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974 Candidates Matches, which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion, Bobby Fischer.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\']'"
